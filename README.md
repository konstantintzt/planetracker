# Plane Tracker
**Try it yourself!**: [planes.tzantchev.com](http://planes.tzantchev.com)

My plane tracker is an interactive website where you can find more information about the planes flying near your!

# How does this work?
When you enter a location, the Google Maps Geocoding API is used to determine the GPS coordinates of this location. Then, the OpenSky Network API (more info below) is used to retrieve data for all planes located in the skies near the entered location.

## OpenSky Network
This project uses data provided by [The OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org) API - *Matthias Sch√§fer, Martin Strohmeier, Vincent Lenders, Ivan Martinovic and Matthias Wilhelm.
